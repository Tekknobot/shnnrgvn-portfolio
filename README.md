# Geo Portfolio (React + Vite)

A minimalist, fast portfolio focused on a single case study: **Geopolitical Dashboard**.
No heavy visualizations included â€” just narrative, structure, and polished UI.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Customize
- Update copy in `src/App.jsx` and `src/components/CaseStudy.jsx`
- Replace the Contact email (`mailto:` link) in `Contact.jsx`
- Change site title and meta in `index.html`
- Add screenshots to `/public` and drop them into the case study if desired

## Deploy
- One-click deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
- `npm run build` then serve `dist/`.
